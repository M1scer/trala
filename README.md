# TraLa - Traefik Landing Page

A simple, modern, and dynamic dashboard for your Traefik services. This application automatically discovers services via the Traefik API and displays them in a clean, responsive grid. It's designed to be run as a lightweight, multi-arch Docker container.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by using the pre-built Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry.

### `docker-compose.yml` (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach. Add this service to your existing `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  traefik:
    image: "traefik:v3.0"
    # ... your existing traefik configuration ...
    command:
      # ...
      - "--api.insecure=true" # Required for the dashboard to access the API
    networks:
      - traefik-net # A shared network

  trala:
    image: ghcr.io/dannybouwers/trala:latest
    container_name: trala
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - traefik-net # Must be on the same network as Traefik
    volumes:
      # Optional: Mount a configuration file. See "Configuration" section below.
      - ./configuration.yml:/config/configuration.yml:ro
    environment:
      # Required: The internal Docker network address for the Traefik API
      - traefik_api_host=http://traefik:8080
      # Optional: Change refresh interval
      - refresh_interval_seconds=30
      # Optional: Change the search engine
      - search_engine_url=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=
      # Optional: Set to "debug" for verbose icon-finding logs
      - log_level=info
    labels:
      # --- Traefik Labels to expose TraLa itself ---
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.rule=Host(`trala.your-domain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.trala.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
      - "traefik.http.services.trala.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"


networks:
  traefik-net:
    driver: bridge
```

## üîß Configuration

The application can be configured with a configuration file and with environment variables. Environment overwrite settings from the configuration file. To view the effective configuration after startup, enable debug logging.

A sample configuration file is shown below:

```yaml
# TraLa Configuration File
# Version 1.0

version: 1.0

environment:
  selfhst_icon_url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/
  search_engine_url: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=
  refresh_interval_seconds: 30
  log_level: info
  traefik:
    api_host: http://traefik:8080
    enable_basic_auth: true
    basic_auth:
      username: user
      password: pass  

icons:
  overrides:
    - service: "TrueNAS SCALE"
      icon: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/truenas-scale.png
    - service: "Home Assistant"  
      icon: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/home-assistant.png

services:
  exclude:
    - traefik-api
    - Authelia
```

Supported environment variables are shown below.

| Variable                   | Description                                                                                             | Default                                | Required |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `traefik_api_host`         | The full base URL of your Traefik API. From within Docker, this is typically `http://traefik:8080`.        | `(none)`                               | **Yes** |
| `selfhst_icon_url`         | Base URL of the Selfhst icon endpoint. Customize if you are hosting your own local instance. | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/`                               | No |
| `refresh_interval_seconds` | The interval in seconds at which the service list automatically refreshes.                                | `30`                                   | No       |
| `search_engine_url`        | The URL for the external search engine. The search query will be appended to this URL.                    | `https://www.google.com/search?q=`     | No       |
| `log_level`                | Set to `debug` for verbose logging of the icon-finding process. Any other value is silent.              | `info`                                 | No       |

### Icon Overrides

While TraLa does its best to find the right icon, fuzzy search isn't perfect. For ultimate control, you can provide ovverides in the `configuration.yml` file with the `overrides` key. This is the most powerful feature for customizing your dashboard.

#### How It Works

The application uses the **router name** from your Traefik configuration (the part before the `@`) as the primary identifier for a service. You can map this router name to either:

1. A full URL to an icon (e.g., `https://selfh.st/content/images/2023/09/favicon-1.png`)
2. A specific icon filename from the [selfh.st icon repository](https://selfh.st/icons/)

**This override has the highest priority.** If a router name is found in this file, TraLa will use the specified icon and skip all other detection methods.

When using a filename from the selfh.st icon repository, you can specify files with the following extensions:

- `.png` (default if no extension specified)
- `.svg`
- `.webp`

The application will automatically construct the appropriate URL based on the file extension

### Service Exclusion

You can hide specific services from appearing in the dashboard by specifying their router names in the `configuration.yml` file with the `exclusions` key. This is useful for hiding administrative interfaces or services you don't want to be easily accessible through the dashboard.

#### How It Works

The application uses the **router name** from your Traefik configuration (the part before the `@`) to identify services. By adding router names to the exclusion list, those services will not be processed or displayed in the dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building Locally

If you want to build the image yourself:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dannybouwers/trala.git
    cd trala
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t trala .
    ```

3. **Run the locally built image:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e TRAEFIK_API_HOST="http://<your-traefik-ip>:8080" trala
    ```
