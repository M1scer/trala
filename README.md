# TraLa - Traefik Landing Page

A simple, modern, and dynamic dashboard for your Traefik services. This application automatically discovers services via the Traefik API and displays them in a clean, responsive grid. It's designed to be run as a lightweight, multi-arch Docker container.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Auto-Discovery:** Automatically fetches and displays all HTTP routers from your Traefik instance.
- **Advanced Icon Fetching:** Intelligently finds the best icon for each service using a robust, prioritized strategy.
- **Icon Overrides:** Manually map router names to specific icons for perfect results every time.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface with automatic Light/Dark mode based on your OS settings.
- **Live Search & Sort:** Instantly filter and sort your services by name, URL, or priority.
- **External Search:** Use the search bar to quickly search the web with your configured search engine.
- **Lightweight & Multi-Arch:** Built with Go and a minimal Alpine base, the Docker image is small and compatible with `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by using the pre-built Docker image.

### `docker-compose.yml` (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach. Add this service to your existing `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  traefik:
    image: "traefik:v3.0"
    # ... your existing traefik configuration ...
    command:
      # ...
      - "--api.insecure=true" # Required for the dashboard to access the API
    networks:
      - traefik-net # A shared network

  trala:
    image: ghcr.io/dannybouwers/trala:latest
    container_name: trala
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - traefik-net # Must be on the same network as Traefik
    # No need to expose ports directly when using Traefik
    # ports:
    #   - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      # Optional: Mount a local file to override icons. See "Icon Overrides" section below.
      - ./icon_overrides.yml:/config/icon_overrides.yml:ro
    environment:
      # The internal Docker network address for the Traefik API
      - TRAEFIK_API_HOST=http://traefik:8080 
      - REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30
      # Optional: Change the search engine
      - SEARCH_ENGINE_URL=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=
    labels:
      # --- Traefik Labels to expose TraLa itself ---
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      # Create a router named 'trala'
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.rule=Host(`trala.your-domain.com`)"
      # Use the 'websecure' entrypoint (assuming you have one for HTTPS)
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.entrypoints=websecure"
      # Enable TLS for the router
      - "traefik.http.routers.trala.tls=true"
      # Define the service and its port
      - "traefik.http.services.trala.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"


networks:
  traefik-net:
    driver: bridge
```

### `docker run`

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name trala \
  -v /path/to/your/icon_overrides.yml:/config/icon_overrides.yml:ro \
  -e TRAEFIK_API_HOST="http://traefik:8080" \
  -e REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS="30" \
  -e SEARCH_ENGINE_URL="https://www.google.com/search?q=" \
  ghcr.io/dannybouwers/trala:latest
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Icon Overrides (Advanced)

While TraLa does its best to find the right icon, fuzzy search isn't perfect. For ultimate control, you can provide an `icon_overrides.yml` file. This is the most powerful feature for customizing your dashboard.

### How It Works

The application uses the **router name** from your Traefik configuration (the part before the `@`) as the primary identifier for a service. You can map this router name directly to a specific icon file from the [selfh.st icon repository](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/tree/main/png).

**This override has the highest priority.** If a router name is found in this file, TraLa will use the specified icon and skip all other detection methods.

### Creating the `icon_overrides.yml`

1. Create a file named `icon_overrides.yml` on your Docker host.
2. Use the following simple YAML format:

    ```yaml
    # icon_overrides.yml
    # Format: <traefik_router_name>: <selfhst_icon_filename.png>

    # Example 1: Your 'firefly-core' router should use the 'firefly-iii.png' icon.
    firefly-core: firefly-iii.png

    # Example 2: Your 'unifi-controller' router should use 'ubiquiti-unifi.png'.
    unifi-controller: ubiquiti-unifi.png

    # Example 3: Your 'traefik-dashboard' router should use 'traefik.png'.
    traefik-dashboard: traefik.png
    ```

3. Mount this file into the container at `/config/icon_overrides.yml` using a volume, as shown in the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker run` examples above.

### Icon Resolution Strategy

TraLa uses the following priority order to find an icon for each service:

1. **Override File:** Checks if the router name exists in `/config/icon_overrides.yml`.
2. **Fuzzy Search:** Performs a fuzzy search on the router name against the cached list of `selfh.st` icons.
3. **Favicon Proxy:** Looks for a `/favicon.ico` at the root of the service's URL.
4. **HTML Parsing:** As a last resort, attempts to parse the service's HTML for a `<link rel="icon">`.
5. **Fallback Letter:** If all else fails, displays a colored tile with the first letter of the router name.

## üîß Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables:

| Variable                   | Description                                                                                             | Default                                | Required |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `TRAEFIK_API_HOST`         | The full base URL of your Traefik API. From within Docker, this is typically `http://traefik:8080`.        | `(none)`                               | **Yes** |
| `REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | The interval in seconds at which the service list automatically refreshes.                                | `30`                                   | No       |
| `SEARCH_ENGINE_URL`        | The URL for the external search engine. The search query will be appended to this URL.                    | `https://www.google.com/search?q=`     | No       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Building Locally

If you want to build the image yourself:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dannybouwers/trala.git
    cd trala
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t trala .
    ```

3. **Run the locally built image:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e TRAEFIK_API_HOST="http://<your-traefik-ip>:8080" trala
    ```
